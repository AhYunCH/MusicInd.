                                I was holding on for dear life Complicated, understated, on the way to devastated We were young and out of our minds Right now I'm sorry Burns through me, darling
                                But I can't help think in 30 years it won'tSo, maybe when I'm older Maybe when I'm older
                                I'll run out of stories about you, yeah Maybe when I'm older Maybe when I'm older I'll know what it's like not to love you anymore

                                Playing house, immature, picking out furniture Praying that our hearts would play fair Emotional souvenirs, fleeting moments, golden years
                                Close my eyes and I go back there Right now I'm sorry Burns through me, darling But I can't help think in 30 years it won't

                                We are the poor ones
                                Rowing up against the tide
                                Burning our reserves of courage
                                And working just to make it alright
                                When we know it isn't
                                We know it isn't, we know it isn't
                                We know it isn't, it ain't gonna turn out right

                                Some of us'll barely get by
                                They buy diamond studded shoes with our taxes
                                Anything to keep us divided, you know it isn't

                                Fight, cause the promise is never gonna be enough
                                Watching and waiting for answers
                                Hoping we might see the light
